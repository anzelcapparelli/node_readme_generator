// trying to see if I can capitalize from array of sections to make section titles & ToC jumps; would make adding sections as easy as adding to one array, and the inquirer question to collect it

let test = ["fruit"]

copytest = [...test];

copytest = (copytest.toUpperCase())[0][0]


console.log(copytest)

console.log(copytest[0][0])
