  ## Description
  
  This node app generates a readme for projects, and applies a general layout
  
  ## Installation
  
  Node.js, and the module 'inquirer' need to be downloaded to run this app in addition to the 'index.js' file on GitHub. Alternatively, downloading the 'index.js' and the 'package.json' from GitHub, then running ```sh\n npm i ``` will download the necessary modules for the app to work.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Run ```sh\ node index.js ```\n, answer the prompted questions, and a generally formatted README.md file will be generated at the end of collecting input
